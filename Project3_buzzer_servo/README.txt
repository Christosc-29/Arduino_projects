This project simulates an automatic door using an Arduino Uno, a servo motor, a button, and a passive buzzer.
Pressing the button toggles the door between open and closed positions:

When opening:

Servo moves from 0° → 90°

Buzzer plays an “opening” sound

When closing:

Servo moves from 90° → 0°

Buzzer plays a “closing” sound
